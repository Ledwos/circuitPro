# Circuit StopWatch!

## Description:

> For the longest time, I thought it would be really useful to have a timer that doesn't stop! Every single smart phone and wearabale device has a 'stopwatch' built in however after those 30 seconds it's over. 

> - What if I'm doing HIIT training and I want a countdown of 30 seconds on / 15 seconds off?
>
> - What if I'm planking and it's time to change position? Can't reset my watch because it's too awkward  / it interrupts my workout
>
> - What if I'm doing an activity but I can't take a full '20 second' break because half of that time is fiddling with the device to continue my study streak?
>
> With all these problems in mind I would've thought a solution would exist by now and yet here we are.
> 
>As an aspiring web developer, I can now stop complaining and provide my own solution to make life easier.

## User Stories:

>### As a user I want to:
>
>- have a UI to set a timer for my current activity
>- have a start / stop button to control the timer
>- have the timer repeat itself until I tell it to stop
>- add aditional timers to build a 'circuit' allowing for more complex routines
>- stop the timer and it will stop at it's current location in the 'circuit' until I tell it to resume
(as opposed to restarting the circuit)
>- have a counter showing me the number of completed 'circuits'
